          <h3>Picking a dataset</h3>
          <p>
            The Big Apple, The City That Never Sleeps, Empire City. Whatever
            your favourite nickname for New York City is, I
            <strong>love</strong> this magnificent city. As soon as I came
            across
            <a href="https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us/">NYC Open Data</a>, I
            was sure I wanted to use a dataset from this website. The difficult
            part was actually picking a dataset. Many of these datasets sparked
            the creative part in my brain and I was unsure what I wanted to work
            on. In the end, I went with
            <a
              href="https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/New-York-City-Population-by-Borough-1950-2040/xywu-7bv9"
              >New York City's Population by Borough from 1950-2040</a
            >. I immediately had an idea of what I wanted to show and how I
            wanted to represent this. </br></br>
            The realisation of this idea can be
            viewed on the right; a map that depicts the five boroughs'
            population as a percentage of the total population in NYC. To me,
            the results were rather interesting. Contrary to my (completely
            ungrounded) hypotheses, people moved out of Manhattan and into
            Queens. The visualisations show that people moved out of Brooklyn in
            the past few decades. However, the predictions of 2030 and 2040 show
            an increase in this borough's relative population. Staten Island
            shows a steady increase in relative population and The Bronx follows
            a similar pattern to that of Brooklyn.

        <h3>Working with unfamiliar tools</h3>
        <p>
          For this challenge, I knew I wanted to experiment with some code. I had worked with python before and a lot with JavaScript, but never used it to create graphs, maps or even animations. 
          So, the visualisation challenge seemed like a proper time to start exploring these domains of the programming world. To generate the images, I used a combination of three python libraries: <a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/">pandas</a>,
          <a href="https://geopandas.org/">geopandas</a> and <a href="https://matplotlib.org/">matplotlib</a>. As these libraries have a large number of dependencies, I worked in <a href="https://jupyter.org/"></a>jupyter notebook because the <a href="https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/">conda environment</a> already contained
          a large number of these dependencies.

        </br></br>
        To build my story around this, I used <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/">bootstrap</a> for fast creation of the website and <a href="https://jqueryui.com/">JQuery</a> to build the interactive slider and animation using the generated images.
        One of the results can be found left to this paragraph; the same animation as before with absolute numbers. It shows roughly the same pattern as with the relative population change.

          <h3>Visualisation</h3>
          <p>
            In my opinion, the change in both relative and absolute population can be slightly difficult to see. This is mainly caused by Staten Island. 
            Generally, it's population and it's percentage of the total NYC population are significantly lower than the ones of the other four boroughs.
            Therefore, the minimum value has to set quite low compared to the other variables. This causes less variations in colour in the higher values.
            Since the values of the other four boroughs can be considered high and because Staten Island's pattern is already pretty clear, I decided to recreate the visualisations
            without showing this borough. To minimise impact on performance, the visualisations can be found on <a href="withoutstatenisland.html">this page</a>.

          <h3>Reflection</h3>
          <p>
            Even though, I think I reached the goal for this visualisation challenge, I'm not entirely happy with the final result.
            This can be blamed on my poor planning. Because I wasn't entirely sure what colour scheme I wanted to use, I used different ones.
            Only using different colour schemes for the relative and absolute values for example would have provided more consistency. 
            Furthermore, this website is very slow. I believe this has to do with me the high quality of the images and inefficient coding.
            The speed of the website definitely impacts the user experience in a negative way. Also, I wish I would have taken the time to really get to know the libraries I used for the visualisations.
            I struggled with essential tasks such as renaming the legend, labeling the slider and styling the titles making the final product not as polished as I wish it would have been.
  
          </br></br>
          Besides the points of improvement mentioned in the previous paragraph, I think this challenge is a good start. 
          I got acquainted with new python libraries and learnt new programming skills. 
          Despite my time management issues, I believe my visualisation is of decent quality.
          In the end, I really enjoyed working on this project involving the city of my dreams.
